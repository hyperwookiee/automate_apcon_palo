#This script was created to automate packet captures on APCON whenever the Palo Alto firewall reports receiving fragmented IP packets above a set threshold value.

#Feel free to modify to fit your needs.

#This script assumes that sending and receiving ports and filters are already setup on APCON.
#An aggregation ID from the Record Settings window is required.  

#Requires requests and paramiko packages
#pip install requests paramiko

#Please edit the actual Python script to add required information
